my_model file: A file that contains the pre-trained neural network data for classifying new and unknown hand gestures

objs.pkl - objs6.pkl : Vectors containing labeled hand gesture data in pairs of 30.

ran.pkl : Vector set containing unlabeled (unknown) hand gestures.

gameplay.py : A python code that includes expandable markov chain rock-paper-scissors-spock-reptile class

Handtrack.py : A python code that created objs files (feature vectors) from image sets.

ObtainData.py : A python code that is used to obtain images.

ME569_Cont: A demonstration code that displays the names of hand gestures shown continuously

ME569_Cont_MultiFrameTest: Main gameplay code. Pressing "c" records the hand gesture, and the "machine" plays its own gesture to win in an expandable rock-paper-scissors game.
